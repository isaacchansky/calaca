# Calaca.css
Adding style to bare bones.

## What's this?
A drop-in CSS file that styles tags directly to keep your markup clean.

## Why would you do this?
I've often started projects using bootstrap or something to get a basic 'decent' look for a project.
Soon enough, I want to break away from bootstrap and do something a bit more sophisticated, usually using a BEM style css architecture.
With a project riddled with bootstrap classes, this is a pain.
So, using calaca.css, while prototyping you can keep your markup thoroughly classless and simple, so when you inevitably do switch to something more complex, you don't have to spend time 'tearing down' the previous implementation.
